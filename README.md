This is just the UI folder. Don't add anything to it, any other python files you add outside of this. 

first run a server in the UI folder using "python -m http.server 8000" or similar 
then run your app.py file inside the API folder

To test the server if it changes values, run the simulate_detection.py for false values.

Now you just need to have the arm to interact with the app.py so that it can update the values inside the data.json file
