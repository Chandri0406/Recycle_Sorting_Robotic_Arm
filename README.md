# Recycle_Sorting_Robotic_Arm
A robotic arm that can sort by detection, picking and placing.

first run a server in the UI folder using "python -m http.server 8000" or similar 
then run your app.py file inside the API folder

To test the server if it changes values, run the simulate_detection.py for false values.

Now you just need to have the arm to interact with the app.py so that it can update the values inside the data.json file
